Guess the Number

This is a simple game that you can guess a number/integer between 0 and 50.
You have 4 tries to guess the number/integer.
The game does give you hints as to if the number is higher or lower than your guess.
If you guess the number correctly there is a text that will let you know.
The game doesn't have a score keeper yet.
Once you have tried 4 times and you don't guess it right there is a play again function.
