I created this pong game that is colorful and bright.
The background is a sky blue with a salmon ball and black paddles.
There is a scoreboard that keeps track of Player A & Player B.
If you miss the ball it will give a score to the other player.
The left paddle is controlled by the letter W & S on your keyboard.
The right paddle is controlled by the up and down arrows on your keyboard.
The ball is wrapped and will show up on all four sides.
The paddle is also wrapped to match the ball.
There is a sound played each time the ball is hit.
It is continuous game with no stop score and will continue.
Please exit the game if you will not like to play anymore.
