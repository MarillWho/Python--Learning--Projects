This is rock, paper, scissors with Greek gods & goddesses.
I created this game that allows a fun interpretation of what would happen.
I have listed the choices with 5 Greek gods/goddesses (Athena, Hermes, Apollo, Hecate & Hephestus).
I defined the variables and made a list of who would beat who.
Listed below is each of the circumstances:

Athena: She outsmarts Hephestus, she bores Apollo to death, Hecate causes Athena's phasmaphobia & Hermes out talks Athena.
Hermes: He outruns Hecate, he out talks Athena, he is blinded by Apollo & he can't run anymore, Hephestus broke his shoes.
Hephestus: He burns the witch, Hecate, he breaks Hermes' shoes, he is lulled asleep by Apollo & he is outsmarted by Athena.
Hecate: She contributed to Athena's phasmophobia, she vexes Apollo, she is burnt to death by Hephestus, she is outrunned by Hermes.
Apollo: He blinds Hermes, he lulls Hephestus to sleep, he is vexed by Hecate & he is bored to death by Athena.

Each of these conditions were made after some research was done and which power I like better.
There is a loop that will ask for your choice, whether you win, lose or tie and if your choice is invalid.
After each loop/question it will ask if you would like to play another round. 
There is no score keeper on this version, may be able to update it later on.
